# Welcome to PrototypeML

## Overview

Neural network architectures are most often conceptually designed and described
in visual terms, but are implemented by writing error-prone code. PrototypeML is
a machine learning development environment that bridges the gap between
the design and development processes: it provides a highly intuitive visual neural
network design interface that supports the full capabilities of the
PyTorch deep learning framework, reduces model design and development time,
makes debugging easier, and automates many framework and code writing idiosyncrasies.
